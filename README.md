# fancyLaunch

## Description

`fancyLaunch` is a small Swift project that was created as a template to include a storyboard-based launch screen. The main aim for it
is to smooth the transition from the launch screen to the app. By using animations while loading the data in the background, showing the
usual spinner upfront is avoided.

`fancyLaunch` is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.
